## Final Report

### Summary

We implemented a fully-concurrent cuckoo hash table. On the Latedays cluster consisting of two six-core Xeon E5-2620 processors, our 24-thread implementation achieved ~13x speedup over a `C++11 std::unordered_map` with little degradation in performance over various workloads.

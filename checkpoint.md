### Work Completed

### Deliverables Progress

### Planned Demo

For the parallelism competition, we plan to show a graph with the results of our performance benchmarks and describe the improvements we made to the original lock-free hash table implementation.

### Concerns

* Planned improvements to the initial lock-free hash table implementations may break invariants
* We haven't decided on which improvements we will make to the initial implementation.
